# Catalog Records Embed Code
A bespoke audio embed code that mimics the first generation Zora embed codes that fell into deprecation.

## Usage

Use `get-filtered-array.mjs` to filter the catalog records by the desired criteria. The script will output a JSON file with the filtered records.

```bash node get-filtered-array.mjs```

Place array.json (the filtered array) in the same directory as the dist folder on the server.
